# Welcome to your new Django project!

This is the ``django-skeleton`` app developed by [adamcharnock](https://github.com/adamcharnock).
To get started you should:

1. [Setup your skeleton project](skeleton_project_setup.md)
2. [Get it running locally](running_locally.md)

## What? This isn't a skeleton app!

Really? Well that probably because the project is based on django-skeleton but 
these docs have yet to be updated. The instructions in 
[get it running locally](running_locally.md) should (hopefully) still be 
largely applicable.
